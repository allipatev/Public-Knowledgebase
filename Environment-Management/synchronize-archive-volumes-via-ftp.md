# Synchronize Archive Volumes via FTP

**IMPORTANT: This article was written prior to Exasol version 6.1 and effectively uses several mechanisms that significantly changed since that time (network interface setup for Script Language Containers, network interface names, availability of remote backups proxied by EXAoperation over FTP etc.). Most likely, it won't work with modern Exasol versions.**

## Background

With this UDF (backup_copy_ftp.sql) written in Python, you can easily synchronize archive volumes between clusters. Transport is TLS encrypted (self._ftp = FTP_TLS). After volumes have been initially synchronized, all files added or deleted will be added or deleted in the target archive volume. This UDF does not support synchronizing specific days or backup IDs, but it can be easily adjusted to your needs. Parallelism is handled by the database. So for best performance, the number of database and master nodes of the target archive volume should be the same.

## Prerequisites

* Your Remote Archive Volumes must be accessible to the Exasol cluster.
* The user creating the UDF must have permission to create the script in a schema

## How to synchronize archive volumes via FTP

In this section, you can replace the title of "How To ..." to something that fits the theme better. 

## Step 1: Create the UDF

Open the attached file (backup_copy_ftp.sql) and create the script in the schema of your choice. Within the UDF, you should adjust these variables accordingly:


```python
LOCAL_URL    = 'ftp://ExaoperationUser:EXAoperationPW@%s/SourceArchiveVolumeID' 
REMOTE_URL   = 'ftp://EXAoperationUser:EXAoperationPW@%s/TargetArchiveVolumeID' 
REMOTE_NODES = [ 'IP node 11', 'IP node 12', 'IP node 13']
```
## Step 2

Once the script is created, you can run it like this:


```sql
SELECT syncBackups(IPROC) FROM EXA_LOADAVG;
```
If needed, you can run this script regularly. 

## Additional Notes

If a synchronization attempt fails, you must cleanup the target volume manually
